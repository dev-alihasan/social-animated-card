# Animated Card Design

This repository contains an HTML and CSS code for creating an animated card design. The code is designed to display a series of cards with images and text that animate when hovered over.

## Features

- **Card Layout**: The code uses a grid layout to display multiple cards.
- **Hover Animation**: When a card is hovered over, it scales up, changes its shadow and border, and displays a semi-transparent background.
- **Text Animation**: The text within the card also animates, scaling down and fading in when the card is hovered over.
- **Image Animation**: The image within the card blurs and scales up when the card is hovered over.
- **Responsive Design**: The design is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the HTML and CSS files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Customization

- **Card Content**: You can customize the content of each card by modifying the HTML within the `<div class="card__content">` element.
- **Images**: Replace the `img-1.jpg`, `img-2.jpg`, etc., with your own images. Make sure to update the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag.
- **Colors**: You can customize the colors used in the design by modifying the CSS variables in the `design.css` file.
